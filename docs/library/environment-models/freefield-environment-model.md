# Free Field Environment Model
:warning:*(Section under construction)*:warning:
 
The **Free Field Environment Model** simulates sound propagation in a free-field environment, focusing on the direct sound path. Specifically, it models the propagation delay, distance-based attenuation, and filtering effects caused by the medium.  

In a free-field environment, sound propagates without any interaction with obstacles or boundaries, such as walls or objects, allowing it to travel unimpeded from the source to the listener. This type of propagation is characterized by the **inverse-square law**, which states that the sound intensity decreases proportionally to the square of the distance from the source. This phenomenon, known as **distance-based attenuation**, plays a crucial role in how we perceive the loudness of sounds in open spaces.

Additionally, sound waves traveling through a medium, such as air, are subject to **frequency-dependent filtering**. Higher frequencies are more susceptible to attenuation due to energy absorption by the medium, which results in a natural filtering effect as the distance increases. This filtering can significantly impact the timbre of sounds heard at greater distances.

The model also accounts for **propagation delay**, which represents the time it takes for sound to travel from the source to the listener. This delay is determined by the speed of sound in the medium, which is approximately 343 m/s in air under standard atmospheric conditions. By accurately simulating these factors, the Free Field Environment Model provides a realistic representation of sound propagation in open environments.
