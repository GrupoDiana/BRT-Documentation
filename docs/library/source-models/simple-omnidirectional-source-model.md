# Omnidirectional Source Model
:warning:*(Section under construction)*:warning:

The omnidirectional source model acts as a simple entry point for the application into the library, in fact it is one of the main entry points for the application during rendering. We say that this model is simple because it is limited to passing both the source position and the input samples provided by the application to all modules that need them. This means that applications must at least provide the audio samples at each frame and update their position and orientation if necessary.
