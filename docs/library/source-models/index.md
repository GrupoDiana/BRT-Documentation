# Overview

Source models are components associated to sound sources. Every soun source has to be connected to a source model which may transform the sound sreeam as a function of the source position (location and orientation) and the listener location. Therefore if a source feeds two listener models, two instances of source models are required.

Currently, two source models are implemented:

* [Directivity Model](directivityModel.md)

* [Simple Omnidirectional Model](simpleModel.md)
