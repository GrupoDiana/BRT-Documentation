# Virtual Source Model  

:warning:*(Ready for review)*:warning:

The **Virtual Source Model** is an internal component of the BRT Library, used primarily by certain environment models to simulate complex acoustic scenarios. For each original source, the model generates multiple virtual sources that may differ in position, orientation, and audio samples. These virtual sources act as independent omnidirectional sources, enabling accurate representation of reflections, reverberation, and other spatial effects.  

This model is not intended for direct use by applications but instead functions as a foundational tool for the library's environment models to perform advanced acoustic simulations.
