In this section, we describe the various OSC commands used to control the listener. These commands not only manage basic parameters like position and orientation but also define the models applied for simulation. These models come with a range of controllable parameters and can simulate either just the listenerâ€™s head through a Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF), or include the surrounding environment using a Binaural Room Impulse Response (BRIR), as the BRIR models the combined impulse response of a head situated within a room. See [listener models](/BRT-Documentation/library/listener/models) for more information.

## `/listener/location`

Set location of listener. Position is set in global x,y,z coordinates, expressed in meters. The new location is sent to all remotes except the one has sent the message.

#### Syntax

`/listener/location <string listener_id> <float x> <float y> <float z>`

`listener_id`: identifier assigned to the listener.

`x`: X global coordinate, expressed in metres. As a reference, X axis is positive to the front.

`y`: Y global coordinate, expressed in metres. As a reference, Y axis is positive to the left.

`z`: Z global coordinate, expressed in metres. As a reference, Z axis is positive to up.

#### Return

In case of success, an echo is sent to all subscribers except the sender, using the same syntax as the received message.

#### Example

BeRTA receives and echoes back to all subscribiers but the sender: `/listener/location defaultListener 0 0 0`

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## `/listener/orientation`

Sets orientation of the listener. Orientation is set in egocentric coordinates yaw, pitch and roll, expressed in radians and applied in that order (Yaw, Pitch and Roll). An orinetation of (0, 0, 0) corresponds to be oriented towards positive X. The new orientation is sent to all remotes except the one has sent the message.

#### Syntax

`/listener/orientation <string listener_id> <float yaw> <float pitch> <float roll>`

`listener_id`: identifier assigned to the listener.

`yaw`: Yaw, expressed in radians. Positive to the right.

`pitch`: Pitch, expressed in radians. Positive upwards.

`roll`: Roll, expressed in radians. Positive to the right.

#### Return

In case of success, an echo is sent to all subscribers except the sender, using the same syntax as the received message.

#### Example

BeRTA receives and echoes back to all subscribiers but the sender: `/listener/orientation defaultListener 0.1 0 0`

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

The HRTF is assigned to all the listener models which may accept it. See [listener models](/BRT-Documentation/library/listener/models) for more information. Currently, these are the Listener models accepting it:

* [Listener Model based on Direct Convolution with HRTF](/BRT-Documentation/library/listener/directHRTF). 

* [Listener Model based on convolution with HRTF in the Ambisonic domain](/BRT-Documentation/library/listener/ambisonicHRTF)


#### Syntax

`/listener/setHRTF <string listener_id> <string HRTF_id>`

`listener_id`: identifier assigned to the listener.

`HRTF_id`: identifier assigned to the HRTF.

In case of success, an echo is sent to all subscribers except the sender, using the same syntax as the received message.

#### Example

BeRTA receives and echoes back to all subscribiers but the sender: `/listener/setHRTF defaultListener HRTF1`

## `/listener/enableInterpolation`

In the case of a [Listener Model based on Direct Convolution with HRTF](/BRT-Documentation/library/listener/directHRTF), this command switch on or off the interpolation among HRIRs. In case it is on, a barycentric interpolation is applied among the three nearest HRIRs surrounding the source direction of arrival. See [HRTF grids]() for more information.

#### Syntax

`/listener/enableInterpolation <string listener_id> <boolean enable>`

`listener_id`: identifier assigned to the listener.

`enable`: If true (1), enables interpolation of the HRTF of the listener. If false (0), interpolation is disabled.

#### Return

`/control/actionResult /listener/enableInterpolation <string listener_id> <bool enable> <string description>`

The return confirmation refers to the `listener_id`, indicating `enable=true` if the model has been enabled and `enable=false` if not. In both cases a `description` is added to give more details. 

In case of success, an echo is sent to all subscribers except the sender, using the same syntax as the received message.

#### Example

## `/listener/enableNearFieldEffect`

This command switches on or off the  Near Field Compensation (NFC) applied together with the convolution with the HRTF. For the NFC to work, a set of NFC filters must first be loaded from a SOFA file (`/resources/loadNFCFilters`) and then assigned to the listener model (`/listener/setNFCFilters`). If there are several models with the NFC feature linked to the listener, this command will affect all of them. The models with this feature currently are:

* [Listener Model based on Direct Convolution with HRTF](/BRT-Documentation/library/listener/directHRTF). 

* [Listener Model based on convolution with HRTF in the Ambisonic domain](/BRT-Documentation/library/listener/ambisonicHRTF)

#### Syntax

## `/listener/enableITD`

This command switches on or off the simulation of ITD separate from the intrinsic ITD which could be included as initial delays in HRIRs. For the ITD simnulation to make sense, HRIRs stored in the HRTF SOFA file should be aligned. Then the ITD can be extracted from the initial delays stored in the Data.Delay field of the SOFA structure. However, the ITD simulation can also use a spherical head modelto sintesize ITD. See also the commands `/resources/enableWoodworthITD` and `/resources/setHRTFHeadRadius` for more information. If there are several models with the ITD simulation feature, this command will affect all of them. The models with this feature currently are:

* [Listener Model based on Direct Convolution with HRTF](/BRT-Documentation/library/listener/directHRTF). 

* [Listener Model based on convolution with HRTF in the Ambisonic domain](/BRT-Documentation/library/listener/ambisonicHRTF)

#### Syntax

`/listener/enableITD <string listener_id> <boolean enable>`

`listener_id`: identifier assigned to the listener.

`enable`: If true (1), enables ITD. If false (0), ITD is disabled.

If there are several models with this parallax correction feature, this command will affect all of them. The models with this feature currently are:

* [Listener Model based on Direct Convolution with HRTF](/BRT-Documentation/library/listener/directHRTF). 

* [Listener Model based on convolution with HRTF in the Ambisonic domain](/BRT-Documentation/library/listener/ambisonicHRTF)
