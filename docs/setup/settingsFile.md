# The Settings file

Both BeRTA-renderer and BeRTA-GUI read the whole configuration of the simulation from a settings file with JSON syntax. This file defines the audio interface settings, the model architecture, and, optionally, a set of resources to be re-loaded at the beguining and a complete scenario with sources and listeners.
