# BeRTA Renderer
BeRTA Renderer is an audio renderer that integrates the BRT library and works for Windows x64 (Windows 10 and 11) and MacOS Universal. 

It is an application that is entirely by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sound_Control" target="_blank">OSC</a>. Thus its graphical interface is limited almost exclusively to reporting the rendering status.
